      In case you feel your symptoms are specific to the coronavirus, your healthcare provider can get in touch with CDC or the local healthcare departments for testing instructions. There are specific labs set up for conducting coronavirus tests, so you may be directed to one of these labs. 
      There are different types of coronavirus tests that can be done: 
      - Swab Test – In this case, a special swab is used to take a sample from your nose or throat
      - Nasal aspirate – In this case, a saline solution will be injected into your nose and, then a sample is taken with a light suction
      - Tracheal aspirate – In this case, a thin tube with a torch, also known as a bronchoscope, is put into your mouth to reach your lungs from where a sample is collected. 
      - Sputum Test – Sputum is thick mucus that gets accumulated in the lungs and comes out with a cough. During this test, you’re required to cough up sputum in a special cup or a swab is used to take a sample from your nose. 
      - Blood test – In this case, a blood sample is taken from a vein in the arm.

      Reports of animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented around the world. Most of these animals became infected after contact with people with COVID-19, including owners, caretakers, or others who were in close contact. We don’t yet know all of the animals that can get infected.
      At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to people. More studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by SARS-CoV-2.
      Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this is rare. This is what happened with SARS-CoV-2, which likely originated in bats.

      - Metal : doorknobs, jewelry, silverware
      5-9 days
      - Wood : furniture, decking
      4 days
      - Plastics : milk containers and detergent bottles, subway and bus seats, elevator buttons
      2 to 3 days
      - Stainless steel : refrigerators, pots and pans, sinks, some water bottles
      2 to 3 days
      - Cardboard : shipping boxes
      24 hours
      - Copper : pennies, teakettles, cookware
      4 hours
      - Aluminum : soda cans, tinfoil, water bottles
      2 to 8 hours
      - Glass : drinking glasses, measuring cups, mirrors, windows
      Up to 5 days
      - Ceramics : dishes, pottery, mugs
      5 days
      - Paper : mail, newspaper
      The length of time varies. Some strains of coronavirus live for only a few minutes on paper, while others live for up to 5 days.
      - Food : takeout, produce
      Coronavirus doesn't seem to spread through food.
      - Water: Coronavirus hasn't been found in drinking water. If it does get into the water supply, your local water treatment plant filters and disinfects the water, which should kill any germs.
      - Fabrics: clothes, linens
      There’s not much research about how long the virus lives on fabric, but it’s probably not as long as on hard surfaces.
  utter_out_of_scope:
  - text: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase?
  utter_fda:
  - text: The FDA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials across the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA staff are working around the clock to support development of  medical countermeasures and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating, and preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the human and animal food supply and take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products.
  utter_sanitizer:
  - text: The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
  utter_vape:
  - text: E-cigarette use can expose the lungs to toxic chemicals, but whether those exposures increase the risk of COVID-19 or the severity of COVID-19 outcomes is not known. However, many e-cigarette users are current or former smokers, and cigarette smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia.
  utter_dose3:
  - text: The FDA updated the emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to allow for the use of an additional dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. People who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and are not immunocompromised do not need an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine at this time.
  utter_blood:
  - text: In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus.
  utter_drug:
  - text: If you have additional questions, call the FDA’s Division of Drug Information at (855) 543-3784 or email us at druginfo@fda.hhs.gov.
  utter_varient:
  - text: Experts are continuing to monitor these variants around the world to better understand their impact, including on children. So far, the evidence doesn’t suggest that these variants are specifically targeting children, and severe illness in young people remains relatively rare.
  utter_vaccnew:
  - text: WHO says that the vaccines approved to date are expected to provide at least some protection against the new variants.
  utter_children:
  - text: |
      We are still learning how it affects children. We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected and transmit the virus, although older people and/or those with pre-existing medical conditions seem more likely to develop serious illness.
      Seek care early if your child is having symptoms and try to avoid going to public places (workplace, schools, public transport) to prevent it spreading to others.
  utter_travel:
  - text: Anyone planning a trip should always follow local and national guidance on whether it is advisable to travel. Those traveling should check the advisory for their destination for any restrictions on entry, quarantine requirements on entry, or other relevant travel advice.
  utter_delta:
  - text: ' Delta is regarded as one of the most contagious forms of the coronavirus so far, and currently accounts for the majority of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.'

  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
  utter_origin:
  - text: This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - test : |
      We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways.
      The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
      Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.
      The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols remain suspended in the air or travel farther than 1 metre (long-range).
      People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus when touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: It is highly unlikely that people can contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging.
  utter_corona_spread_warm:
  - text: With the start of summer coming soon, many are hopeful that the warmer weather will slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
  utter_corona_spread_risk:
  - text: COVID-19 is often more severe in people who are older than 60 years or who have health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes or conditions that affect their immune system.​

  utter_corona_stats_check:
  - text: 'Covid-19 Tracker [India] : Please Enter the State name you wish to see the Covid-19 Statistics : '
  utter_corona_community:
  - text: Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
  utter_corona_mosq_spread:
  - text: At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
  utter_corona_prevent:
  - text: |
      Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others 
      Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. 
      The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible
  utter_corona_symptoms:
  - text: COVID-19 symptoms include:CoughFever or chills Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Muscle or body aches Sore throat New loss of taste or smell Diarrhea Headache New fatigue Nausea or vomiting Congestion and many more
  utter_corona_vaccine:
  - text: 'Human clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine initiated in India: ICMR. Human clinical trials for a vaccine for Covid-19 have been initiated with approximately 1,000 volunteers participating in the exercise for each of the two indigenously developed vaccine candidates.'
  utter_corona_infected person:
